#Goals: 
  **dynamic programming.** -- Done :heavy_check_mark:  
  **Subset sums** -- Done :heavy_check_mark:  

  **_partition a sequence of n positive integers into three subsequences such that the sum of each subsequence is the
same_**. 

	Ex(1):Input (10, 20, 30, 40, 40, 50, 80), the three subsequences could be (10, 80), (20, 30, 40), and (40, 50) with each with a sum of 90.
	Ex(2):Input (20, 20, 30, 50),then no solution is possible.
